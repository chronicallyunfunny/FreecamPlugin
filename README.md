# FreecamPlugin
NoClip/Freecam whatever you want to call it.

From https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simple-noclip-freecam.88842/:

## A simple survival-ready (remembers your gamemode) noclip plugin that works with the latest version of Minecraft. Give any suggestions in the comments if you want to suggest features.

If you are still confused it is basically freecam except your character actually moves.

Typing /nc puts you in spectator mode. Typing /nc again puts you back in survival (for example), and back to your exact location.

## Instructions:
Type /noclip, /nc, /freecam, or /fc to noclip.

## Permissions:
noclip.nc to noclip through blocks.

## Config (config.yml):
enable: Enables or disables the plugin.
